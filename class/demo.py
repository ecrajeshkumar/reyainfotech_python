'''
class Dog: creates a class named Dog, which acts as a blueprint for dog objects.
species is a class attribute, meaning it is shared by all instances of the class.
__init__() is a constructor method that runs automatically when a new object is created. It is used to initialize object data.
self refers to the current object, allowing each object to store and access its own data.
self.name and self.age are instance attributes, unique to each Dog object created from the class.

class Dog:
    species = "Canine"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age  # Instance attribute

# Creating an object of the Dog class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(dog1.name) 
print(dog1.species)
